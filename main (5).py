#Implement a function called sort_students that takes a list of student objects as input and sorts the list based on their CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average) in descending order. Each student object has the following attributes: name (string), roll_number (string), and cgpa (float). Test the function with different input lists of students.

class student:
  def __init__(self,name,roll_number,cgpa):
    self.name=name
    self.roll_number=roll_number
    self.cgpa=cgpa
def sort_students(student_List):
    sorted_students= sorted(student_List,key=lambda student:student.cgpa,reverse=True)
    return sorted_students
students=[student("Hari","A123",7.8),
         student("Srikanth","A124",8.9),
         student("Saumya","A125",9.1),
          student("Mahidhar","A126",9.9)]
sorted_students= sort_students(students)
for student in sorted_students:
  print("Name:{},Roll number:{},CGPA:{}".format(student.name, student.roll_number, student.cgpa))
